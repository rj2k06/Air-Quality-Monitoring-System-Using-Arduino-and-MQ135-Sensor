# Air Quality Monitoring System Using Arduino and MQ135 Sensor
This project is an Air Quality Monitoring System developed using the Arduino Uno microcontroller and an MQ135 gas sensor, designed to provide real-time air quality analysis and alert users about hazardous conditions.

The core function of the system is to continuously monitor air quality by detecting the concentration of various harmful gases in the environment such as ammonia (NH₃), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), benzene, smoke, and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The data collected from the MQ135 sensor is processed by the Arduino, which calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on predefined thresholds.

Once the AQI value is calculated, the system categorizes the air quality as either "Good" or "Bad". These classifications are based on preset limits programmed into the Arduino to reflect acceptable safety standards.

The results are then displayed on an LCD module connected to the system, providing a clear and immediate visual readout of both the AQI value and its corresponding status. Additionally, the system includes a visual and auditory alert mechanism:

If the air quality is good, a green LED is activated, indicating safe environmental conditions.
If the air quality is poor, a red LED is turned on alongside a buzzer alarm, warning users of potentially hazardous air.
## Key features of the project include:
### Real-time AQI monitoring using the MQ135 air quality sensor
### Automated classification of air quality as "Good" or "Bad"
### Instant feedback via LCD display, LED indicators, and buzzer alerts
### Compact and cost-effective solution for indoor air quality monitoring
### Microcontroller-based control logic using the Arduino Uno platform

This project showcases a practical application of embedded systems and environmental sensing to address growing concerns around air pollution. It serves as a foundational step towards developing smarter, more responsive air quality management solutions.
